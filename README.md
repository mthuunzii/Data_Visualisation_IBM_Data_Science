This repository contains all my hands-on labs completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.
Data Visualization for Effective Communication
One of the key skills developed in this course was the ability to create impactful data visualizations. 
Visualization plays a critical role in helping stakeholders quickly understand trends, patterns, and outliers in data. 
I learned how to select the most appropriate chart types for various kinds of data and insights, and how to design clear and meaningful visuals that support data-driven decision-making.
